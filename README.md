# FakeFlix Movie Search App

## Overview

FakeFlix is a dynamic web application that allows users to search for movies using the OMDb API and display them and their information and poster as search results. This project was created to practice and demonstrate proficiency in React and modern web development practices.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Movie Search:** Users can search for movies by title, and view results including posters, titles, and year of release.
- **Responsive Design:** The app is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Interactive UI:** Utilizes state management and conditional rendering to provide an interactive and intuitive user interface.

## Skills and Concepts Practiced

- **React Fundamentals:** Deepened understanding of React functional components, JSX, and React's rendering cycle.
- **State Management with `useState`:** Revisited managing component state, handling user input, and updating the UI in response to state changes.
- **Side Effects with `useEffect`:** Utilized for performing an API call to fetch movie data and set the movies array to an initial search and display it upon the initial page load.
- **API Integration:** Integrated with the OMDb API to fetch movie data based on user queries.
- **Conditional Rendering:** Implemented ternary operators for conditionally rendering UI elements, enhancing the user experience based on the application state.
- **Array Manipulation in JSX:** Used the `map` method to dynamically render lists of movie data, demonstrating an understanding of JavaScript array methods and their application in React.
